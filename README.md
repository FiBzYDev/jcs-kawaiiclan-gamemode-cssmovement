  Once you're connected to mysql it should make all the tables on its own, if not use the sql file in the database folder


Enjoy!

# My Backstory

I started playing gmod bhop in 2014 on a server called pG.
![285100932-6603e73f-dcaf-4925-92fe-28f5ecdd990f](https://github.com/FiBzYDev/jcs-kawaiiclan-gamemode/assets/58349075/621b07af-89dc-40ec-ba09-3fb4245ff9c9)
picture taken on my server in 2016 with friends

I played with ZQK, Matt7220, Cat, Garry's Bhop, Henwi, Sad rainbow, lolu, rhythm, rq and a few others on pG and GFL Clan. Everyone was nice and enjoyed playing on my servers in 2014 through 2017. We used to make jokes, make eachother laugh while playing. I brought a gamemode from George Ri for about 65 USD it was the best gamemode at its time. GMod Bunny Hop was really popular with 32 full players on pG at the time. I was nice to everyone I used to make everyone Admins. I started my server called StrafesOnFleek in 2015. Everything was going good then I decided to give the George Ri gamemode to Garry's Bhop because he wanted his own bhop server at the time there was no public bhop gamemodes released i'm pretty sure I gave it to henwi too and rhythm had it also I don't remember how he got it I think from George Ri. After that Flow gamemode was being worked on by Gravious and Push. Things started to part ways when Ruta's World was being created. justa started to dev for Ruta's World in 2018 people were starting to leave bhop and servers died down alot. Something changed the players started to become disrespectful, mean and toxic. Staffs were abusing Admin powers. I started to cut everyone off at this time. Henwi started to turn into a different person, Rhythm went missing and Garry's Bhop stayed on Henwi's side. Meanwhile justa started to dev for GMod Kawaiiclan where everyone that was still left played on. 2019 is where it all went to dust the GMod bhop community was destroyed. justa became toxic and money driven and they all stayed with him Cat, Sad Rainbow ect. Justa started to make a private whitelisted kawaiiclan gamemode for only his remaing friends, which became justa's cool server. By 2020 is where everyone got even worse. I had lorp help me start a Linux server and he put a backdoor in the server without me knowing. I started to play more CS:S bhop and I wanted to created a CS:S bhop gamemode for GMod because I thought CS:S had better UI, Movement ect... I was paying justa to dev for me I gave him alots of money to add Jhud, Strafe Trainer, CS:S Hud for my gamemode. Everyone who was left started to bully me because of it. Vehnex was the leader along with cat and the others. They even sent 500 boxes to my house, started ruining my server they got acess to the backdoor and Vehnex started to make youtube videos of me and DDoS me. He called me fibtard and by then everything was over. justa and henwi were in a deal to get me to give 2000$ USD to him and I fell for it. He took it all and used it on a new PC. He scamed me and took over 2500$ Dollars from me and after time he gave rq the public gamemode which had all the thingsI paid for all for free. justa is money driven and will use you to get some cash. justa finally quit bhop in 2023 and took down his server. No one remains left on gmod bhop to this day only a few people. I wanted a RNGFix for GMod and justa would not give me any more of his code even for money. I came across DotShark and ClazStuio and I had to talk to them for over a month to get them to give there version they finally gave it after bribery. Bhop when downhill and became the most toxic community on GMod. And I had it with everyone by then. I decided to release all my code and make my version of justas private gamemode since that was the best gamemode and smoothest they said. I was whitelisted once when justa was helping me dev for StrafesOnFleek and I wasn't focused on GMod Movement he took me off whitelist pretty quickly. I decided to give rq the RNGFix to show the community I had something cool and so they would change. I would have liked to work with justa and helped create a smoother gamemode. I did nothing wrong and i wish things didnt have to end this way but they did and its over now so enjoy this release. 

This is a picture of what they did to the bhop server in 2020

Note I was like only 17 at the time i was getting upset so I got my mother to talk to then to get them to stop and it only got worse.
